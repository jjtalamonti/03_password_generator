# Cryptic Password

## Description

This project was designed to give the user a secure, randomized password based on the parameters inwhich they set. I believe this project helps solve the issue of creating a multi-character password. I initially had trouble creating a check this for password parameters. I then decided to restart, basically from the beginning, and create a passord generator run by command prompts.
